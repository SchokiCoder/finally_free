# later

- [ ] remove crafting grid (too limiting for complex recipes)
- [ ] remove item: wooden sticks
- [ ] add sulfur ? (for tnt)
- [ ] make chests inventory into lists that hold n items regardless of stacking rules
(much more efficient)

- [ ] add burner fuel tools, that spawn enemies when used
- [ ] add electric tools, that don't, while still being as quick

# now

- [x] buff movement speed
With that also add Wuzzy's playerphysics mod,
because that rabbit-hole is a thing apparently.

- [x] update README
Also put deps in a modpack.

- [ ] replace "minetest." with "core."
- [ ] add slight pov shift when crouching
- [ ] bring back old mining sound
