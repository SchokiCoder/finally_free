# Finally Free

A fork of the minetest_game base.  
For now I do stuff, and hopefully have fun.  
We'll see if it goes anywhere.  

## Installation

### ContentDB

Currently not.  
Maybe later.  

### Manually

- Unzip the archive, rename the folder to `finally_free` and
place it in `.../minetest/games/`

- GNU/Linux: If you use a system-wide installation place it in `~/.minetest/games/`.
